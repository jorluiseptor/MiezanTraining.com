						<h3>About William</h3>
						<p>My name is William Miezan. I have been teaching physical education and coaching track and field for more than 20 years. I’m presently employed as a teacher in one of D.C private schools. My background in personal training, I’m a former National Strength Professionals Association certified and have worked in local fitness centers including Washington Sports Club and Results Gym.</p>
						<p>I am a Level One track and field certified with USA Track and Field and former track and field athlete for the Ivory Coast, West Africa where I am originally from. My other areas of expertise include soccer, volleyball, and wrestling. I graduated from the University of Ivory Coast with a Bachelor’s Degree in Physical Education and Sports. I’m fluent in French and working knowledge in Spanish.</p>


						<h3>My philosophy</h3>
						<p>
						My philosophy of training is one that defines me as a teacher in all I do. I believe that there is a big difference between a coach and a teacher. A coach will get the job done by his athletes regardless of their emotions and feelings because of the demand of that sport. A teacher on the other end will get the same job done, but will take into consideration the initial state, the background, the strength and weakness, the complaints of the student, and so many other things. A teacher will use encouragement as a motivational tool.  A teacher is patient with his students.  A teacher uses a progressive approach to reach his goals. Over the years I developed the “push yourself, but know your limit” concept because of an incident that happened with one my sons who was 6 years old at the time. He had joined a group of kids for a basketball practice and started to push himself too hard to soon because he wanted to show off his skills. Within a few minutes he was out of breath and started showing signs of exercise induced asthma. Since that day, I’ve been preaching not only to him, but also to anybody I work with: “Challenge yourself gradually, but also listen to your body.”
